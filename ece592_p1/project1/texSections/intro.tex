This project covers an implementation and study of image compression using \textit{k-means} clustering. We show that an image can be reconstructed from representative patches that are learned from its particular distribution of pixels. Qualitatively, the reconstruction is not particularly unappealing and the quantitative results are not poor, either.
\\\\
As a further experiment, we generated our own implementation of \textit{k-means} in MATLAB that is qualitatively similar to the output of MATLAB's built in \code{kmeans(.)} function but does not yet compete in terms of time to execute and quantitative distortion values.
\\\\
The code used to execute this project can be found in Appendix A.
