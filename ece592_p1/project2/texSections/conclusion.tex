In conclusion, we have shown that at least two algorithms are feasibly implemented in MATLAB to find the shortest distance between two cities in North Carolina- Dijkstra's Algorithm and the A* Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm, while slower, has a lower memory overhead than A*, which requires a pre-calculated heuristic function to achieve it's speed improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm.
