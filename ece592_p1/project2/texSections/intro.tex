This project covers an implementation and study of shortest path algorithms; namely, Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm were explored for their ability to find the shortest distance between any two cities in North Carolina. In this project, we show the results of our implementations and compare the time and memory performance of each algorithm.
\\\\
The code used to execute this project can be found in Appendix A.
